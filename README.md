**VIMRC**

This is my (Neo)Vim setup. Tested on Windows and Ubuntu.
I recommend NeoVim for Windows, as Vim doesn't support mouse and has a few visual bugs on Windows terminal.

**FEATURES**
- Quick compile/run command, which supports many filetypes
- Templates when creating new files, based on their extension
- Custom StatusLine, which can be customized per colorscheme
- Some window management shortcuts, such as :T for a terminal split
